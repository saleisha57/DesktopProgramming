		<p> As a way to record my recipes in one spot I am making this page in correlation with my Instagram food blog. </p>
		<p> My main focuses include cooking, baking, and food combination testing. My style for cooking is to create different combinations of spices and herbs, along with testing different techniques to create a unique cooking experience. </p>
		<p> Please use the link below to see all of the recipes. </p>
